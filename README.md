# Minecraft-Coord-Bruteforce

A collection of tools for bruteforcing the coordinates of a particular location in a minecraft world.

So far the tools are
  - A bedrock pattern matcher for the Nether
  - A mansion locator.
 
View their respective directories for more details.

The code is not very clean since it was written for one-off personal use,
but it gets the job done and I can't find many other examples online. Hopefully this helps others
seeking to do similar things.


As configured, the presets are meant for finding coordinates in LiveOverflow's "Minecraft Hacked" Youtube series world.
This is what the programs were written for.
